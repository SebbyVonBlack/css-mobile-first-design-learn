## Overview
The primary goal of this project was to better understand how
to approach a mobile first design idealogy. Considering over 55% percent of people viewing websites comes from mobile, I believe it to be beneficial to understand mobile first design to encompass the majority of people that may view the site.

This project was a follow along tutorial by Net Ninja focusing on mobile first design. Not only did I learn MFD, but along the way I learned the basics of Grid styling, as well as the use of break points.
